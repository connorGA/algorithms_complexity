# Algorithms and Complexity { `Big O` }

Time Complexity - a measure of how fast an algorithm runs. Time complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews. It's expressed using Big O Notation.

Space Complexity - a measure of how much auxillary memory an algorithm takes up. Space complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews. Also expressed using Big O Notation.
